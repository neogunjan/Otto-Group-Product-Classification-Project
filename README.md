# Kaggle Otto Group Product Classification Project

This project was inspiried by the kaggle competetion, "Otto Group Product Classification Challenge." The Otto Group is one of the world’s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France). Otto Group sells millions of products worldwide every day. Due to the diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of the product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights can be generated about the product range.

The dataset contains 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between the main product categories.

In this project, the models that were used were: Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K-means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors, EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Neural Networks (NN). The best results were computed using an ensemble method with XGBoost and NN. These models were critiqued based on the log loss function.
